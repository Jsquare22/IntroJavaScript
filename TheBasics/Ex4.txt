console.log('5' + 10);

this prints out 510 because javascript changes 10 from a number
to a string then interpolates the two making 510 instead.

Better way to phrase it:
Every + expression that has a string operand produces a string.
Number 10 gets coerced into a string then concatenated to the string '5'
